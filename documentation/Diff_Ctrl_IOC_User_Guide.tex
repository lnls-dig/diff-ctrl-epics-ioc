%--- About this manual ---
\paragraph{}{\Large\bfseries About this manual}

\paragraph{} This manual provides an overview of the Diff Ctrl EPICS Soft IOC. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basics of EPICS.

%--- Table of contents ---
\tableofcontents

\newpage
%--- Section: Introduction ---
\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{} The Diff Ctrl EPICS IOC is a Soft IOC that controls the position of 2 'blades' or 'edges' that move in opposite directions. This IOC aims to meet the needs of different applications that could have this description. In case of Sirius, it is used for Slits and Scrapers at the accelerator. Since both systems use DMC 30017 Galil controllers, the PVs accessed by the Diff Ctrl IOC in order to command the motors of a given device are provided by (two) instances of the \href{https://github.com/lnls-dig/galil-dmc30017-epics-ioc}{Galil DMC 30017 EPICS IOC support by LNLS}.

\paragraph{} The Diff Ctrl IOC repository is \url{https://github.com/lnls-dig/diff-ctrl-epics-ioc}.

%--- Section: Installation ---
\section{Installation}

    \paragraph{Shortcut} It is possible to run a \emph{docker image} containing the IOC and all of its dependencies. Go to the \hyperref[sec:run-with-docker]{Running the IOC from a docker container} section to see how to do it.

    \subsection{Installing without docker}

        \paragraph{Before everything} Make sure you have EPICS Base 3.15 and the following EPICS modules installed (older versions might work but are not recommended):

        \begin{itemize}
          \item autosave R5-9
          \item seq 2-2-6
          \item calc R3-7
          \item busy R1-7
        \end{itemize} 

        \paragraph{} Clone the IOC repository and checkout the desired commit (in case you are not using master).

            \vspace{1mm}
            \begin{code}
git clone https://github.com/lnls-dig/diff-ctrl-epics-ioc.git <install location>
cd <install location>
git checkout <commit>
            \end{code}
            \vspace{1mm}

        \paragraph{} Create a \emph{RELEASE.local} file inside the \emph{configure/} directory and add the paths to EPICS Base and external modules. An example file is available at \emph{configure/RELEASE.local.example}.

            \vspace{1mm}
            \begin{code}
echo 'EPICS_BASE=<EPICS Base path>' > configure/RELEASE.local
echo 'AUTOSAVE=<Autosave path>' >> configure/RELEASE.local
echo 'SNCSEQ=<seq path>' >> configure/RELEASE.local
echo 'CALC=<calc path>' >> configure/RELEASE.local
echo 'BUSY=<busy path>' >> configure/RELEASE.local
            \end{code}
            \vspace{1mm}

        \paragraph{} From the IOC $<$TOP$>$ directory, run make:

            \vspace{1mm}
            \begin{code}
make
            \end{code}
            \vspace{1mm}

%--- Section: Running the IOC without docker ---
\section{Running the IOC without docker}

    After successfully building the IOC, from the IOC top directory, run:

        \vspace{1mm}
        \begin{code}
cd iocBoot/iocDiffCtrl &&
./runDiffCtrl.sh <options>
        \end{code}
        \vspace{1mm}

    The available options can be listed by passing any invalid option to the startup script, such as:

        \vspace{1mm}
        \begin{code}
./runDiffCtrl.sh -h
        \end{code}
        \vspace{1mm}

    or can be consulted in the README.md file at the IOC $<$TOP$>$ directory or project page \url{https://github.com/lnls-dig/diff-ctrl-epics-ioc}.

%--- Section: Running the IOC from a docker container ---
\section{Running the IOC from a docker container}\label{sec:run-with-docker}

    \paragraph{} Make sure you have docker installed and that you understand the basics of creating, running and acessing a container, and downloading an image.

    \subsection{Downloading the image (IOC + dependencies)}

        \paragraph{} The image named \textbf{lnlsdig/diff-ctrl-epics-ioc} contains the compiled IOC and dependencies, and can be downloaded to your machine by running:

        \vspace{1mm}
        \begin{code}
docker pull lnlsdig/diff-ctrl-epics-ioc:<IOC_TAG>
        \end{code}
        \vspace{1mm}

        where \emph{$<$IOC\_TAG$>$} should be replaced by the desired IOC version.

        \paragraph{} The IOC version list can be found at \url{https://hub.docker.com/r/lnlsdig/diff-ctrl-epics-ioc/tags}.

        After the IOC image is downloaded, you can instante it by running a container that uses it.

    \subsection{Running a docker container with that image}

        \paragraph{} One way to run the container is to do:

        \vspace{1mm}
        \begin{code}
docker run -it --network host --restart always --name <CONTAINER_NAME> lnlsdig/diff-ctrl-epics-ioc:<IOC_TAG> -P <PREFIX1> -R <PREFIX2> <other options>
        \end{code}
        \vspace{1mm}

        Which is going to run the container starting at its default entrypoint, that is, the IOC startup script. The parameter $<$IOC\_TAG$>$ should be replaced by the IOC version. All the arguments after it are passed to the IOC startup script when run in this way. The $<$PREFIX1$>$ and $<$PREFIX2$>$ are the IOC EPICS PVs prefix, combined as follows: \emph{PV\_PREFIX = PREFIX1 + PREFIX2}. The other startup script arguments should be provided as well. They are listed in the IOC README.md file.

        \paragraph{} \textbf{If you run this command before downloading the image, the image is automatically downloaded, provided there is internet connection}.

        \paragraph{} Below you find an explanation for each flag we used in the above command.

        \begin{itemize}
          \item -it: interactive (STDIN open) and allocate pseudo-TTY. Since we did not change the container entrypoint, your terminal is going to connect to the IOC shell.
          \item --network host: configures the container to use the host's network stack inside the container. It is the simplest configuration to use, although it provides no isolation.
          \item --restart always: restarts the container automatically when it exits.
          \item --name $<$CONTAINER\_NAME$>$: configures the container name as $<$CONTAINER\_NAME$>$.
        \end{itemize}

        \paragraph{} In order to stop the docker container, i.e., the IOC, run:

        \vspace{1mm}
        \begin{code}
docker stop <CONTAINER_NAME>
        \end{code}
        \vspace{1mm}

        \paragraph{} If you want to delete the container, after stopping it, run:

        \vspace{1mm}
        \begin{code}
docker rm <CONTAINER_NAME>
        \end{code}
        \vspace{1mm}

        \paragraph{} You can also run the contaier with the \emph{--rm} flag to clean up the container and remove the file system when it exits.
